Guessing Letters: The second player (the "guesser") attempts to guess the word by suggesting letters one at a time. If the guessed letter is in the word, the host fills in the blanks with that letter. For example, if the guesser guesses "p," the host would update the display to "_ p p _ _".

Incorrect Guesses: If the guessed letter is not in the word, the host adds a part to the hangman drawing (e.g., the head, body, arms, and legs).

Winning and Losing: The guesser wins if they can guess the word before the hangman is fully drawn. Conversely, the host wins if the guesser exhausts their allowed number of incorrect guesses before identifying the word.
